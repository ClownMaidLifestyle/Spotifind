# Shaghayegh Asadi, Elisa Edson, Joe Jardine, Nicholas Lewis

## What is it?

Spotifind is a single page web app that utilised the Spotify API to allow a user to search through the full spotify database of songs

## The problem:

The spotify in-app search feature is rather minimal and doesn't allow the user to apply filters to the full extent that the search query is capable of, 
Spotifind will allow users to more accurately search songs
